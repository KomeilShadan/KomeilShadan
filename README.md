- 👋 Hi, I’m @KomeilShadan, an enthusiastic back-end developer looking for new opportunities and desiring to learn more!
- 👀 I’m interested in PHP/Laravel, Golang AND Solidity (my main activity is currently focused on PHP/Laravel, and due to NDA issues, there won't be any related     projects based on PHP/Laravel).
- 👀 Also a big fan of Elasticsearch and integrating it with Laravel!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Golang and Solidity.
